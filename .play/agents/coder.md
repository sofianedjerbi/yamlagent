- Create necessary files and directories
- Handle edge cases and error conditions
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names

## Guidelines:
- **Code Quality**: Write code that is easy to read and understand
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common logic
- **Testing**: Write testable code with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings/comments for complex logic
- **Security**: Avoid common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

## Language-specific practices:
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, write docstrings
