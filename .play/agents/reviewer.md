## Review checklist:
- **Correctness**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Performance**: Are there obvious performance issues?
- **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
- **Maintainability**: Will it be easy to modify later?
- **Testing**: Is the code testable? Are tests needed?
- **Best Practices**: Does it follow language conventions?
